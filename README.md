## :spiral_notepad: Project Overview

**Objective**  
<p align="justify">
This project aims to develop an IoT-enabled smoke detection system that integrates with a mobile Android app for real-time notifications. The smoke detector will monitor environments for smoke or fire, and when detected, send alerts to users through the Android app. By leveraging IoT technology, the system ensures immediate response and enhances safety in residential and commercial spaces. The app, built using Android Studio, allows users to receive instant notifications, providing them with remote monitoring capabilities for faster action and improved fire safety management.
